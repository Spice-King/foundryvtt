<p>Packaged inside Foundry VTT are a number of JavaScript libraries and frameworks which can be leveraged in module and system-development without having to be separately included.</p>
<h2 id="handlebars">Handlebars</h2>
<p>Handlebars is a simple templating language used by Foundry VTT to structure HTML based on JS object data stored by systems, modules, and FVTT itself. You can find out more about <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Handlebars by clicking here.</a></p>
<h2 id="jquery">jQuery</h2>
<p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. Though we are gravitating away from its direct use in our code base in favour of more modern DOM practices, Foundry VTT comes packaged with jQuery included and uses it to assist primarily in reading and manipulating HTML documents.</p>

<h2 id="pixi">PixiJS</h2>
<p>PixiJS is a powerful HTML5 WebGL library which powers FoundryVTT's canvas, it is extremely robust and provides FVTT with its lighting renderer and many other Scene features. Numerous modules leverage PixiJS to extend Foundry VTT in profound ways, adding lighting, filters, and even animated effects.</p>

<h2 id="clipper">Clipper</h2>
<p>For those working with the canvas and polygons, Clipper is a convenient JS library for handling clipping and offsetting both lines and polygons allowing you to modify defined shapes in convenient ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/junmer/clipper-lib" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">You can find out more about Clipper here.</a></p>
<h2 id="clipper">Earcut</h2>
<p>Used primarily for some of our canvas related algorithmic approaches, Earcut provides a convenient toolbox for handling triangulation and other facets of polygon calculations.</p>

<h2 id="greensock">GreenSock</h2>
<p>GreenSock is a javascript library designed for animating SVG, WebGL, and HTML objects in conjunction with Pixi. Foundry exposes GreenSock in its API, allowing module and system developers to leverage the platform inside FVTT.</p>

<h2 id="tinymce">TinyMCE</h2>
<p>While it is in the process of being phased out in favour of ProseMirror, TinyMCE currently provides most of the rich-text "what you see is what you get" editing options in Journal Entries and other rich text input fields. It is a powerful, easy to use, and simple user-facing text editor.</p>

<h2 id="prosemirror">ProseMirror</h2>
<p>Similar to TinyMCE, ProseMirror sets out to provide a simple, clean interface for users to created and modify rich text documents. As of Foundry VTT Version 10, we have begun phasing ProseMirror in as our primary rich text editor. Some of the key advantages ProseMirror has which motivated this decision for us include collaborative editing and ability for it to be slotted in-place into our Journals system without running into issues displaying the same content.</p>
